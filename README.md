## FAQ
### How do I change the homepage layout?
You can customize your homepage layout by going to Online Store > Themes > Customize. From there, you can add, remove, and reorder sections to create your ideal layout. Each section has its own settings that you can adjust to match your brand.

### How do I set up the nested mega menu?
To set up a nested mega menu, go to Online Store > Navigation and create a menu structure with multiple levels. The Artisan Market theme will automatically convert top-level menu items with child items into mega menus. You can add images to menu items by using the "Add image" option in the theme editor's Header section.

### Can I use custom fonts with this theme?
Yes, you can use custom fonts with Artisan Market. The theme includes all Google Fonts by default, which you can select in Theme settings > Typography. If you want to use a custom font that's not included, you'll need to add some custom code. Please contact our support team for assistance with custom font integration.
